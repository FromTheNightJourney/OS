### FORUM WEEK 9

In order to use this file, ensure Python is installed. 
If you would like, you may generate a new text file by running textfile_gen.py. Then, to run the main file, run the following command:
```
python main.py [initial_position] nums.py
```
Of course, specify the initial position with an integer of your choice.
The results of my personal test can be found in forum_week9/results.png

Enjoy.
